## Documentation

### Observations

- Throughout the code, ":modelModule" is used in comments as an alias to the name given when the module was instantiated, but there is no such param in the routes.
- Options are passed through as a parameters object, and all of its contents are required, otherwise there will be missing routes and variables. However, error handling of undefined hasn't been implemented yet.


### Basic initialization

:modelModule
options = {
    collection:     "processos",
    defaultPerPage: 10,
    routeNew:       "/novo",
    routeDelete:    "/:item/excluir",
    routeEdit:      "/:item/editar",
    labelNew:       "Novo",
    labelEdit:      "Editar",
    viewNew:        "processos/form.jade",
    viewItem:       "processos/view.jade",
    viewList:       "processos/list.jade",
    viewEdit:       "processos/form.jade",
}

First instantiate a new model by calling `var modelInstance = new crudEasy.newModel(url, collectionName);` and then use the api and crud routes by calling ` app.use([route], crudEasy.crudRoute(modelInstance, optionsObject));`  and `app.use([/api/route],crudEasy.apiRoute(modelInstance, optionsObject));`

```javascript
crudEasy = {
    newModel:   function(url, collectionName){return require('lib/_objectMongodb')(url, collectionName);},
    crudRoute:  function(url, collectionName){return require('lib/crud')();}
}
```
